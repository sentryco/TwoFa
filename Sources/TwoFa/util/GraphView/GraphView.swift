/**
 * This SwiftUI GraphProgressView struct creates a circular progress bar similar to the UIKit GraphProgressView class. The @State property wrapper is used to create mutable state for the progress, threshold, tintColors, backgroundStrokeColor, and lineWeight properties. The body property returns a ZStack that contains two Circle views that represent the background and foreground of the progress bar. The trim(from:to:) modifier is used to create the progress effect, and the stroke(_:style:) modifier is used to set the stroke color and style of the circles. The rotationEffect(_:) modifier is used to rotate the ZStack so that the progress starts from the top. The color computed property returns the appropriate color based on the current progress.
 * - Description: A view that shows a circular progress bar
 * - Note: Used by `OTPArc` and `AuditView`
 * - Note: Works for iOS and macOS
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Animate graph in onApear, maybe later?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Transfer more of the comments from legacy üëà
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Move to TwoFA scope?
